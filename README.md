Google Image Search
===================

This is app for Google Image Search. The total time spent on this app is approximately 11 hours. This assignment is much longer than the previous ones and I didn't even do any of the optionals. I did brush up on the UI a bit to make it look tidy.

I used SharedPreferences for the settings. Initially I wanted to just pass objects through Intent but decided otherwise after the lecture today.

Not sure if it's my problem but the emulator crashes often after I "endless scroll" too much.
